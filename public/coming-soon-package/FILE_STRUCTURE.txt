## Where Files Go on Your Server

### ✅ Correct Structure

```
Web Server Root Directory (public_html or www/)
│
├── index.html                      ← Coming soon page HTML file
├── .htaccess                       ← Apache rewrite configuration
│
└── 📁 images/                      ← Images folder
    └── amin_logo.png              ← Your company logo
```

### ❌ Incorrect Structures (Don't Do This!)

```
❌ WRONG: Files in subfolders
public_html/
├── coming-soon-package/
│   └── index.html          (Wrong location!)

❌ WRONG: Logo in wrong location  
public_html/
├── index.html
├── .htaccess
└── amin_logo.png           (Should be in images/)

❌ WRONG: Missing .htaccess
public_html/
├── index.html              (Without .htaccess, redirects won't work)

❌ WRONG: .htaccess not hidden
htaccess.txt               (Must be named .htaccess with dot)
```

```

---

## File Naming - Important!

⚠️ **Case Sensitive on Most Servers:** Linux/Apache servers are case-sensitive!

### Correct Naming
- ✅ `index.html` (lowercase)
- ✅ `.htaccess` (lowercase, with dot prefix)
- ✅ `images` (lowercase folder name)
- ✅ `amin_logo.png` (exact spelling and case)

### Incorrect Naming
- ❌ `Index.html` (uppercase I - won't work!)
- ❌ `INDEX.HTML` (will not be found)
- ❌ `htaccess.txt` (missing dot, wrong extension)
- ❌ `IMAGES` (uppercase - image path won't match)
- ❌ `Amin_Logo.png` (doesn't match src= in HTML)

---

## What Gets Uploaded vs. What Stays Local

### 📤 Upload to Server (Required for live page)
- ✅ `index.html`
- ✅ `.htaccess`
- ✅ `images/amin_logo.png`

### 📥 Keep Locally (Reference/Documentation)
- 📖 `README.md`
- 📖 `SETUP_GUIDE.txt`
- ✅ `DEPLOYMENT_CHECKLIST.md` (use to track progress)
- 📖 `FILE_STRUCTURE.txt` (this file)

---

## File Permissions (If Using FTP/SSH)

### Recommended Permissions

| File | Permission | Meaning |
|------|-----------|---------|
| `index.html` | 644 | Readable by all, writable by owner |
| `.htaccess` | 644 | Readable by all, writable by owner |
| `images/` (folder) | 755 | Executable (allows browsing), readable |
| `amin_logo.png` | 644 | Readable by all, writable by owner |

**Note:** Most hosting auto-sets permissions. You only need to worry if you get "Permission Denied" errors.

## Troubleshooting File Issues

### Can't See .htaccess
- **Problem:** .htaccess is hidden file
- **Solution:** Enable "Show Hidden Files" in cPanel/FTP settings
- In Windows: `View` → `Show hidden files`
- In cPanel: Click `Settings` → Check "Show Hidden Files"

### Logo Doesn't Display
- **Problem:** Wrong file location
- **Solution:** Ensure images folder exists AND logo is inside it
- **Not this:** `public_html/amin_logo.png` ❌
- **This:** `public_html/images/amin_logo.png` ✅

### Wrong File Format
- **Problem:** Uploaded as wrong type
- **Solution:** Check file extensions
- `.htaccess` NOT `htaccess.txt`
- `index.html` NOT `index.php` or `index.htm`

### File Seems Corrupted
- **Problem:** Transferred in wrong mode (ASCII vs Binary)
- **Solution:** Use Binary mode for all files in FTP
- **Or:** Re-upload the file
