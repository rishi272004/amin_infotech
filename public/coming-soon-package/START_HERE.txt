## 🔑 Key Things to Remember

### ✅ DO:
- ✅ Upload both `index.html` AND `.htaccess` to root
- ✅ Create `images` folder and put logo inside it
- ✅ Enable "Show Hidden Files" to upload .htaccess
- ✅ Use exact file names (case-sensitive)
- ✅ Test URLs like /about to confirm redirects work

### ❌ DON'T:
- ❌ Put files in subfolders (they go in root!)
- ❌ Rename .htaccess to something else
- ❌ Upload logo to root (it goes in images/ folder)
- ❌ Forget to enable "Show Hidden Files"
- ❌ Edit .htaccess unless you know Apache config

---

## 🆘 If Something Goes Wrong

### Quick Troubleshooting

**Problem:** Logo doesn't appear
→ Check if images/amin_logo.png uploaded

**Problem:** URLs show 404 instead of coming soon  
→ Verify .htaccess is in root (enable hidden files)

**Problem:** Can't see .htaccess
→ In cPanel, Settings → "Show Hidden Files"

**Problem:** Styles look broken
→ Hard refresh (Ctrl+Shift+Delete) → Clear cache

**Problem:** Don't know where files go
→ Read FILE_STRUCTURE.txt for clear diagram

---

## 🎨 Customization (Optional)

Want to change something? Find it in `index.html`:

- **Company name:** Search for "Amin Infotech"
